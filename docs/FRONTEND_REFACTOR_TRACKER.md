# Frontend Refactor — Progress Tracker 🏴‍☠️

Companion to `FRONTEND_REFACTOR.md` (the **what** + **why**) and `FRONTEND_REFACTOR_PHASES.md` (the **how**, broken into atomic phases). This file is the live checklist.

Tick a phase's verification box only after running it green. Tick the phase's outer box only when **every** sub-box under it is green.

---

## Phase 0 — Baseline

- [ ] **Phase 0 complete**
  - [ ] `xmake run test-all` captured (pass/fail per suite)
  - [ ] Desktop launched, playwright-cdp snapshots captured for every demo tab
  - [ ] WASM build state recorded (`xmake f -p wasm && xmake build wasm-app`)
  - [ ] Pre-existing failures noted somewhere referenceable

  - [ ] `main` app builds and runs
  - [ ] Theme switching works (incl. Tron and Dragon)
  - [ ] Font switching works (app + editor independently)
  - [ ] Transparency sliders work
  - [ ] Snapshot diff matches Phase 0

### Phase 6 — Monaco package

- [ ] **Phase 6 complete**
  - [ ] `@monaco-editor/react`, `monaco-editor`, `monaco-vim` deps moved to package

  - [ ] Package name decided
  - [ ] Editor tab in `main` loads without console errors
  - [ ] Vim mode works
  - [ ] Editor theme syncs with app theme
  - [ ] Editor font is independently configurable

### Phase 7 — Place bridge transport TS

- [ ] **Phase 7 complete**
  - [ ] Decision recorded: where `bridge.ts`, `bridge-transport.ts`, `wasm-transport.ts`, `system-bridge.ts`, `todo-bridge.ts` live
  - [ ] Transport files moved to chosen location
  - [ ] `main` app builds and runs
  - [ ] Every bridge method round-trips
  - [ ] WASM transport still works (`xmake run dev-wasm` + WASM app launches)
  - [ ] Snapshot diff matches Phase 0

### Phase 8 — Split apps, wire react-router, delete `web/shared/`

- [ ] **Phase 8 complete**
  - [ ] `web/apps/main/` → `web/apps/demo/`

  - [ ] ChatTab fate decided
  - [ ] Vite dev ports per app decided
  - [ ] Storybook globals (`web/shared/styles/globals.css`) landing place decided

  - [ ] `signalReady()` verified in **every** app's mount path
  - [ ] `getBridge<T>(...)` at module scope verified per app
  - [ ] `assetsInlineLimit: 0` verified in every new `vite.config.ts`
  - [ ] `qtSyncGuard` preserved
  - [ ] All three apps build (`bun run build:demo`, `build:settings`, `build:app`)

  - [ ] User can navigate between demo, settings, and app
  - [ ] Snapshot per app captured (new baseline)
  - [ ] Bridge calls work in each app
  - [ ] WASM dev flow still produces a runnable WASM app

## Phase 9 — Test trim

- [ ] **Phase 9 complete**
  - [ ] Catch2 test chosen + others removed (recommendation: `todo_store_test`)
  - [ ] Bun test chosen + others removed (recommendation: `type_conversion_test` against new layout)
  - [ ] Playwright browser test chosen (one demo-todos flow)
  - [ ] Playwright desktop test chosen (recommendation: keep one)
  - [ ] pywinauto test chosen (recommendation: `test_full_dialog_flow`)
  - [ ] Helpers intact (`native_dialogs.py`, `win32_helpers.py`, conftest fixtures)
  - [ ] Each surviving test runs green standalone
  - [ ] Full suite faster than Phase 0 baseline
  - [ ] Each surviving test's name + content makes the demonstrated pattern obvious

## Phase 10 — `scaffold-bridge` update

- [ ] **Phase 10 complete**
  - [ ] Tool templates updated to match new `app/bridges/<name>/` layout
  - [ ] Wiring updates point at new `application.cpp` and `test_server.cpp` registration sites
  - [ ] TS interface emission points at Phase 7's chosen location
  - [ ] Decision: pure-domain placeholder behavior (recommendation: comment + nothing else; don't write into `<repo>/lib/`)
  - [ ] `xmake run scaffold-bridge testbridge` produces a bridge that compiles
  - [ ] Generated bridge registers in both `application.cpp` and `test_server.cpp`
  - [ ] Generated bridge callable from running app
  - [ ] Tool does not write into `<repo>/lib/`
  - [ ] Test bridge removed after verification
