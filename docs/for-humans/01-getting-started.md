# Getting Started

## What Is This?

A template for building apps with a web UI and C++ backend — **two deployment targets** from one codebase:

- **Desktop** — a native Qt window with menus, dialogs, and system integration
- **Browser** — the same app compiled to WebAssembly, runs anywhere with no install

You write React for the UI, C++ for the logic, and the framework bridges them. The desktop version uses Qt's WebChannel. The browser version uses Emscripten's Embind. Same React code, same C++ logic, different transport.

## Why This Stack?

- **Qt** gives you native menus, dialogs, system tray, keyboard shortcuts, window management, and cross-platform deployment
- **React** gives you the entire web ecosystem for UI — components, styling, tooling, hot reload
- **WASM** gives you zero-install browser deployment — same C++ logic, no server needed
- **The bridge** makes them feel like one thing — call C++ from TypeScript, push events from C++ to React

You don't need to learn QML or Qt Widgets for UI. You don't need Electron's memory overhead. Write React and C++ once, ship native desktop and browser.

## Prerequisites

- [xmake](https://xmake.io) — C++ build system
- [Qt 6.x](https://www.qt.io) with these modules:
  - **Qt WebEngine** — Chromium-based web view
  - **Qt WebChannel** — bridge between C++ and JavaScript
  - **Qt WebSockets** — for the dev server and test infrastructure
  - **Qt Positioning** — required by WebEngine at runtime (transitive dependency)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) — JS runtime and package manager
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) — for Playwright tests and playwright-cdp
- [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) — *(optional, WASM target only)* C++ to WebAssembly compiler
- **Linux only:** `libnss3-dev` and `libasound2-dev` (Chromium dependencies)

## Make It Yours

Edit the top of `xmake.lua`:

```lua
APP_NAME    = "Your App Name"
APP_SLUG    = "your-app-name"
APP_VERSION = "0.1.0"
```

This propagates everywhere automatically: window title, binary name, Windows exe metadata, HTML `<title>`, loading screen text. Replace `desktop/resources/icon.ico` and `icon.png` with your own icons.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Point xmake at your Qt installation (one time)
xmake f --qt=/path/to/qt   # e.g. C:/Qt/6.10.2/msvc2022_64

# Build the desktop app (builds React via Vite, then C++)
xmake build desktop

# Run it
xmake run desktop
```

The first build takes ~30 seconds (Vite + C++ compile). Subsequent builds skip Vite if `web/src/` hasn't changed.

## Dev Mode

### React + C++ together (HMR inside Qt)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Vite dev server with hot reload
xmake run dev-web

# Terminal 2: Qt app loading from Vite + CDP debugging on :9222
xmake run dev-desktop
```

Edit a React component, save, see changes instantly inside the native Qt window.

### React only (no Qt needed)

```bash
# Terminal 1: C++ backend over WebSocket
xmake run dev-server

# Terminal 2: Vite dev server
xmake run dev-web

# Open http://localhost:5173 in any browser
```

The dev-server is a headless C++ process that serves your bridges over WebSocket — same bridge code as the desktop app, just without a window. Useful for rapid UI iteration without rebuilding Qt.

### WASM (browser-only, no Qt or backend needed)

```bash
# One-time: build the WASM target
xmake f -p wasm && xmake build wasm-app

# Switch back to desktop config (WASM artifacts persist in build/)
xmake f -p windows --qt=/path/to/qt

# Run the WASM app in browser
xmake run dev-wasm
```

`dev-wasm` copies the WASM build artifacts to `web/public/` and starts Vite with `VITE_TRANSPORT=wasm`. Same React UI, same method names — but the C++ runs as WebAssembly in the browser. No backend process needed.

**React HMR works.** C++ changes require rebuilding WASM (`xmake f -p wasm && xmake build wasm-app`) and refreshing the browser.

> **Note:** After `xmake f -p wasm`, switching back to desktop with `xmake f -p windows` loses the `--qt=` path. Always pass it explicitly.

## Quick Test

```bash
xmake run setup               # install all dependencies
xmake run test-all            # all layers: Catch2 + Bun + Playwright + pywinauto
```

If that's green, everything works.

> ⚠️ **Heads up:** `test-all` includes pywinauto tests that launch the Qt app and drive your mouse/keyboard for ~30 seconds. You won't be able to use your computer during that time. If you're working with an agent, you can ask them to run individual test layers first (Catch2, Bun, browser e2e) — those are completely invisible. See [Testing](04-testing.md) for details.
